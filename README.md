Domination Game
===============

A simulation engine for a multi-agent competitive game. It is meant as an easy experimentation and evaluation
environment for learning about cooperative and competitive autonomous systems. It is:

- **Easy**: written in pure python without dependencies makes sure the code is easy to run
            out-of-the-box and on all platforms. Additionally, the code has a simple API and
            sensible usage.
- **Fast**: the code does not rely on the rendering engine to run simulations, and the collision solver
            is written to be quite fast, leaving plenty of time for agents to think
- **Fair**: the default game rules are tweaked so that it is easy to evaluate the relative skill of agents,
            without too much randomness.

The original concept for the game was developed by Okke Formsma and Arno Veenstra, this 
new version of the framework was developed by Thomas van den Berg and Tim Doolan.

Please refer to the http://rtfd.org/docs/domination-game/ for information on using this framework.
